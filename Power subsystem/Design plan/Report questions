Your group’s GitHub link where all your PCB files, datasheets, etc are stored. This should
be made public at the time of submission of the report.

- What is the problem you are trying to solve?


- Specifications and requirements?


- Context diagram, block diagram, requirements diagram, etc.


- How will you test your system? What have you added to your board to aid this? (things like
jumpers and testing points)


- Design decisions: comparison of components for use in your circuit, why did you choose
certain components over others?


Interfacing diagrams: How does your subsystem work with other subsystems?


- Interfacing table: How does your subsystem connect to other subsystems?


- Bill of materials – how much has your PCB costed (per board and total cost for 2).
