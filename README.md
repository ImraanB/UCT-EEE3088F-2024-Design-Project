# UCT-EEE3088F-2024-Design-Project
This is a repository for the UCT EEE3088F 2024 Micro-mouse Project
# Overall Project
This project involves designing a micromouse that will be able to move through a maze.
There are 4 subsystems that work together to form the micromouse:
## The motherboard
(We are given this) Connects all the PCBs together.
## The Processor
(We are given this) Contains an STM32L476 microcontroller. This microcontroller will be used to program different sections and subsystems of the micromouse.
## The Power
Responsible for powering the entire system:
- Run motors and charge battery
- Fit onto pin headers on motherboard
- It will need to be able to be an apporpriate size for balance and space issues
## The Sensor
Resposible for detecting/sensing objects
- Detect objects
- Fit onto pin headers on motherboard
- It will need to be able to be an apporpriate size for balance and space issues
